# Projectify

## DESCRIPTION

[Projectify](https://jkhbuild.github.io/Projectify/) is a single-page, construction budget generating webapp that aids real-estate developers and prospective tenants in understanding cost feasibility of a project at concept. Predict project costs by inputting square footage of the project area and applying $/SF rates based on construction type (medical office, office, warehouse). All data is visualized on a dynamic bar chart that can be adjusted to understand where scope reduction is needed.
